# Vaccine Uptake Prediction Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict factors influencing the uptake of a vaccine using machine learning techniques. We analyzed survey data to build models capable of classifying individuals as vaccinated or not. The goal was to identify key factors driving vaccination decisions and provide actionable insights for stakeholders in public health or policymaking.

## Problem Statement
The project seeks to answer:

What factors influence the likelihood of vaccine uptake?
How accurately can machine learning models predict vaccination status?
How can these insights help design targeted vaccination campaigns?

## Data
The dataset contains features representing demographic, behavioral, and contextual information about individuals. Key steps included:

Preprocessing: Encoding categorical features, handling missing values, and normalizing numerical data.
Feature Selection: Using data visualizations and correlation analysis to identify important variables.


## Models Used
Four models were developed and evaluated:

Simple Logistic Regression
Simple Decision Tree
Tuned Logistic Regression
Tuned Decision Tree
Each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

## Results Summary
Tuned Logistic Regression and Tuned Decision Tree achieved the highest accuracy (~81%).
Both tuned models showed improved precision for non-vaccinated individuals but struggled with recall for vaccinated individuals.
Class imbalance was a key challenge, as vaccinated individuals (class 1) were underrepresented in the data.

## Key Findings
Top Influential Features: Identified variables that strongly influence vaccine uptake, such as age, education level, and healthcare access.
Model Strengths: High precision and recall for predicting non-vaccinated individuals.
Model Weaknesses: Difficulty in accurately predicting vaccinated individuals due to class imbalance.

## Recommendations
Address class imbalance .
Explore advanced models like Random Forests.
Collect more balanced data.
